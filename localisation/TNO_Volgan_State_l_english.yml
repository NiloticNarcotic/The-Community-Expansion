 ### Leaders ###
 POLITICS_KARL_DONITZ_DESC:0 "Dönitz is a man of means and a man of ideals. A staunch supporter of the Reich from its violent birth to its seemingly violent end, he has seen his even more beloved Kriegsmarine slowly burn away in the flames of rebellion and ruination. While many ships have abandoned the Reich's cause to find harbor with the various supporters, namely the liberals with Speer, Dönitz knows that only one man can truly save the Reich from damnation.\n\nWho better than Bormann? A strong leader, a protégé of Hitler himself, and a staunch believer in the Reich's ideals. Sadly, the Kriegsmarine is no longer safe in harbors where any day another wretched traitor may simply seize their ships to continue their degenerate causes.\n\nLuckily, Dönitz had already secured a 'civilian' post overseeing the ports of Crimea on behalf of the local governor. With dozens of naval ships in port every day and with many an able bodied sailor to aid him, overthrowing this weak governate for the betterment of the Reich was simple. Now he sits in Crimea, waiting for the day his ships can once more return to the mainland and aid the Reich in its glorious rebuilding."

### Events ###
 VLG.4.t:0 "The Wolgabund Coups The Government!"
 VLG.4.desc:0 ""As is often the case in times of crisis, major happenings create ripples which, for the smaller players involved, may result in catastrophic consequences. Once such situation is unraveling right now in Kosakenstadt, the capital of the recently-established Wolga Staat, a hotbed for political confrontation due to the contrast between the native Germans, mostly moderates, and the recent settlers, who are loyal to the NSDAP.\n\nThe political balance of the region had always been tenuous at best, but it has broken out entirely in the last days following the decision taken by Helmuth von Pannwitz to support Feldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner in his bid to bring peace to the region through military force: as soon as the news was out, the moderate parties of the Wolgabund immediately denounced the government, but most had thought it would be the swansong of the Wolga democratic institutions.\n\nThey were disappointed this morning, as a flurry of contradictory news coming from Kosakenstadt report of a coup instigated by the native Germans against the administration. All of them agree on the fact that Pannwitz, due to the little support he enjoyed among the local populace, has been ousted from power, but some sources report that the progressive wing of the Wolgabund managed to form a new government, while others insist that this honor has fallen upon the conservatives.\n\nAs the situation stabilizes, and the first official statement from the new administration come in, there are no more doubts..."
 VLG.4.a:0 "The liberals are in power!"
 VLG.4.b:0 "The social democrats lead the Wolga Staat!"
 
 VLG.5.t:0 "The Freikorps Attack the Wolga Staat!"
 VLG.5.d:0 "When Ferdinand Schörner took power in Moskowien, he had expected all the regional administrations to follow him. Such was not the case, as we have condemned the Feldmarschall and his plans for Eastern Europe which will only bring ruin to all parties involved. Most believed that such a bold statement would not remain unpunished, and today they haven't been disappointed.\n\nAfter several days of tense wait, we were almost starting to believe that they would be able to weather the storm, but it had all been a ploy. With the help of the loyal Freikorps in Kaukasien, the Feldmarschall has launched a pincher offensive in order to subdue us! The mercenaries have struck from the South, while Schörner waits for the perfect moment to attack from the North.\n\nReports coming from the border tell of skirmishes between the first vanguards of the Freikorps and our border outposts, but the situation is escalating quickly. All attempts to reach a peaceful resolution of the crisis have been rejected, and we are officially in a state of war."
 VLG.5.a:0 "We won't give up our freedom!"
 
 VLG.6.t:0 "Raids Intensiying in the north"
 VLG.6.desc:0 "A three page long report from the Northern region of the Wolgastaat reached the desk of Werner Ebeling in a rather unceremonial fashion for what was enclosed within. The clerk that delivered it left about as soon as he came in, leaving Ebeling alone with the click-clicking of the grandfather clock that proudly stood behind him in the office.\n"EMERGENCY REPORT KOSACKENSTADT" The crimson text stared back at the man with urgency that he really was not up to pick up on a Friday afternoon.\n\nThe accursed Northern Volga region has always been a troublesome one. If it wasn't the 'Pokrovsk' theives-in-law, a Russian nationalistic mafia, one day, then it was the Bandits on another. The emergence of the Basegi Black Brigades did not help either. They seemed like they were heavily trained; perhaps they were ex-Red Army or renegade mercenaries.\n\nEbeling was reaching the end of the report. Apparently, the raids have heavily intensified, reaching even small military targets and moderately populated towns. The final few paragraphs of the document made the grey hairs stand on his neck, however. "Many officers have decided to pull their forces out of the region entirely, as well as the amassing desertions in the further-reaching bases. Numerous officers, including myself, have signed to abandon the region, which has been confirmed by the command.""
 VLG.6.a:0 "Something is wrong..."
 
 VLG.7.t:0 "Ershow has been taken!"
 VLG.7.desc:0 "The papers filled up the security minister's table. Telephone calls were coming in non-stop to various different clerks of the Wolgabund office while the staff was desperately trying to keep up with what was going on. Chaos overtook not only the Wolgabund, however, as the entire city of Ershow which still had a substantial Russian population was taken over by the Basegi Black Brigades. The almost complete lack of local authorities resulted in little bloodshed as the entirely Russian police force made no attempts at stopping the bandits from storming the local government building.\nFrom the town, they reorganized and rearmed. The garisson that abandoned their post left in a hurry and left tons of equipment there.\n\nCommander Theodor Busse, overwhelmed by reports from panicked officers, many of which were still fairly young, organized a counter response. The few remaining troops stationed in the region will march into the city and wrest control from the bandits. The response was organized within just a few days and marched off towards the town, hoping to end this uprising, or whatever it was, as soon as it started."
 VLG.7.a:0 "Somebody do something!"

 VLG.8.t:0 "Kosackenstadt authorities overthrown!"
 VLG.8.desc:0 "It seems that the bandits that were the Basegi Black Brigades were looking to be much more than just that. After taking the town of Ershow, they armed up and launched an assault on the city of Kosackenstadt. This one, having a much larger German population, put up a fight, with local authorities standing off with the Black Brigades. They were nowhere near capable enough to fend them off, however, and the city soon fell. The intricate organization of the thieves-in-law mafia which clearly collaborate a lot with the Brigades helped in the pacification of the city.\n\nIt is clear that the bandits are looking to take over our country in its entirety. Whether they are Russian liberationists, power hungry despots or some other ideological quagmire matters not. What is important is that we must defend the soil which we have fought and bled for. It is our birthright and no bandit group will be allowed to take it from us. "
 VLG.8.a:0 "To arms, for the Vaterland!"
 VLG.8.b:0 "The time of the Black Brigades is now!"
