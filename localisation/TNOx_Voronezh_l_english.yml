 VNH_initial.6.t:0 "Journal Entry #1"
 VNH_initial.6.desc:0 "I can’t remember the last time I’ve eaten bread.\nIt's been three months since we’ve arrived in Rabenblatt. Our farm had become too expensive from the land tax; Our available cash was gone, and we had no choice but moving to the city for jobs. Thousands joined our exodus. After packing up our belongings, we arrived at a train station filled with hundreds of families. The train arrived, and we were all placed into cramped train carriages which pushed my brother and I apart from our parents. The stench of the other passengers was unbearable, we gasped for the little air, pressed tightly together in the center of the train cart. I held firmly to my young brother's arm, he couldn’t understand why we had to leave the farm, and his feelings since then had gone from worry to terror; I assured him that once we made enough money in the city, we’d all be returning home soon. We finally arrived in Rabenblatt. With the little money we had, we were able to purchase a small two room apartment; the kitchen doubling as our laundry space, the living room our bedroom, and the window seal becoming a workbench. We were considered the lucky ones; many who couldn’t find housing slept on the streets, or shared the same space we did with five other families. Jobs were much easier to come by. New business was everywhere, and cheap labor was invaluable. My father and I found jobs in a steel mill a few kilometers from our apartment. Mother found part time work at a textile factory much farther away, but less hours meant she could come home early to Pavel. The work is grueling, twelve hours shifts with few breaks. The heat of the factory is excruciating and the noise makes my ears ring. My father struggles the most with the work; his back always hurts, and the chemicals have given him a horrible cough which has only worsened in the passing months. After our first week's work, we were finally given our wage, paid in the new currency of Vozensh, worth little compared to the old reichsmark. All of this would've been tolerable, if it wasn't for the famine. The price for food skyrocketed from the lack of farmers. Our combined wages only afforded the necessities, with new prices for food, we’d often go hungry. Day in and day out we toiled in the mill, only to come home to empty stomachs. Yesterday, my father collapsed seven hours into our shift. I woke him up before he was noticed, but I knew we wouldn’t be so lucky again. After work ended for the day, we returned home, mother was preparing what might have Okroshka. She set the table for dinner, we all sat down with a collective sigh of relief, all with rings around our eyes. Finally my brother Pavel arrived at the table and we began eating. I looked over to see Mother hadn't touched her food, she had no food at all. Pavel looked around the table at the three of us. Maybe now seeing the emotions on us all, the tiredness and regret, he looked to Father and asked, “Why can’t we go home Papa?” My Father burst into tears, sobbing on the table. Seeing my father in this state, seeing how low our lives had fallen, I couldn’t hold back my own tears. Mother embraced us, reaching over the small table. She tried her best to sooth us, “This is our home now. We will make it work”"
