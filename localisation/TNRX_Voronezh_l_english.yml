 VNH_initial.1.t:0 "The First Council Meeting"
 VNH_initial.1.desc:0 "As the members of the council arrived to Voronezh following the collapse of the Reichkomissariat, they one after one entered the hall. \n\nFirst was Mikhail Gorbachev, he took a seat at the very end and started thinking about what to bring up to the meeting. \n\nShortly after Gorbachev came the rest of the council. Savvina, Lukin, Putin, even Bulganin came. They all took their seats next to their compatriates and looked at Gorbachev to begin."
 VNH_initial.1.a:0 "The fate of russian democracy is being decided"
 VNH_initial.2.t:0 "A look at the situation"
 VNH_initial.2.desc:0 "During the meeting, Gorbachev got a report on the situation in Voronezh and the current state of the government. \n\nThe army needed to be addressed and the economy is close to nonexistent. If the council wants to bring stability to Russia, they will need to first bring stability to their region. \n\nLuckily, the council has ideas."
 VNH_initial.2.a:0 "Let's get to work"
 VNH_initial.3.t:0 "A need for strength"
 VNH_initial.3.desc:0 "Not too long after the council meeting ended, Bulganin was in his cabinet waiting for Gorbachevs response on his idea in order to improve the military. He heard the door knock, then proceeded to open it where he saw Gorbachev. Gorbachev came in as Bulganin closed the door behind him, then said; \n\n"Marshal Bulganin, do what you must""
 VNH_initial.3.a:0 "A new army for a new russia"
 VNH_initial.13.t:0 "The offer"
 VNH_initial.13.desc:0 "As time passed at the meeting, Marshal Bulganin has stood up and began proposing his ideas on military improvement. \n\nBulganins reforms included the increase of military budget, a better training programme and basic conscription law. However, this ignores our civilian industry thats in dire state. It's up to Gorbachev to decide the military's direction"
 VNH_initial.13.a:0 "Mr Gorbachev, your move"
 VNH_initial.9.t:0 "The refusal"
 VNH_initial.9.desc:0 "Not too long after the council meeting ended, Bulganin was in his cabinet waiting for Gorbachevs response on his idea in order to improve the military. He heard the door knock, then proceeded to open it where he saw Gorbachev. He came in as Bulganin closed the door behind him. The leader of the council sighed and said; \n\n"Marshal Bulganin, we have more important matters to focus on.""
 VNH_initial.9.a:0 "Another direction taken"
 VNH_initial.5.t:0 "A new day, a new programme"
 VNH_initial.5.desc:0 "With Bulganins proposal accepted by Mr Gorbachev, it's effects began kicking in almost immediately. \n\nFor the most part, the recruits now undergo rigorous training and discipline is being taught very seriously. As of result, not everyone passes due to the pressure and demand, but the large majority that does succeed are now valiantly serving the new republic amidst the chaos."
 VNH_initial.5.a:0 "My allegiance is to the republic, to democracy!"
 VNH_initial.12.t:0 "A shady deal"
 VNH_initial.12.desc:0 "In the middle of the meeting, the almighty oligarch of the council, also known as Spiridonovich Putin put forward a suggestion to Gorbachev. \n\nPutin wants more tax cuts in exchange for better industry output and stability. This will allow Putin and the other oligarchs like Lukin to use their industries for personal gain and in the long run may damage the public sector. \n\nHowever, if Gorbachev comes up with a good alternative he could turn down the oligarchs offer."
 VNH_initial.12.a:0 "A complicated decision"
 VNH_initial.7.t:0 "Igors first job"
 VNH_initial.7.desc:0 "Igor's life has never been very comfortable. First it was growing up in the german colony where he was treated as a second class citizen along with his fellow russians, then the collapse of the Reichkomissariat. \n\nFortunately for him, the recent decisions by the new government have improved the situation by a little bit. Now Igor has a job in his local factory with not perfect but decent safety laws. Igor couldn't thank more likes of Gorbachev who sidelined the robber barons and now provide him a little better conditions to live under."
 VNH_initial.7.a:0 "For Gorbachev!"
 VNH_initial.8.t:0 "An emergency meeting"
 VNH_initial.8.desc:0 "Gorbachev, now believing that the situation has improved has decided to gather the entire council quickly in order to tell something important. The young man stood up and began; \n\n"Members of the council! I believe that now we have improved the mess around here, we must restore order and bring democracy to the rest of the motherland that has been suffering under the german eagle! \n\n-so who is with me?"\n\nAs the council voted on the matter, it was decided."

To that end, we have opened the first meeting of the Voronezh State Council, mending the divide between the former collaborators and the partisans who have returned to resist the Nazi scum.

A meeting has been convened by the Stavka to debate the implementation of a new training program, and so far they seem split between two camps.  One proposal says that we do not have the means to fight an open war, and should therefore train our troops for partisan warfare, focusing on winning through superior logistics and hit-and-run tactics to drain our enemies by attrition. The other faction proposes that we make up for our lack of numbers by providing our soldiers the very best equipment and enforcing strict discipline to create a small, but deadly army."

 VNH_turn_to_lukin:0 "Turn to Lukins Ideas instead"

Political freedoms are few and far between and many are afraid to speak openly about the problems they face in fear of being labeled a communist or fascist. The economy is still in complete disarray; the poor flood the streets, thousands of rural farmers now living in slums and forced to become wage laborers. However, despite the many glaring issues the young nation still faces, there may be a ray of hope yet. With new elections on the horizon, Voronezh is on the path to becoming a shining beacon of Democracy. Government subsidies have jump-started a stagnant industry and have set the Republic on the path to becoming an industrial powerhouse.

The industrialists likes of Lukin and Putin are almost in complete control of the industry, and the army is headed by Bulganin.

She wants a state with a mixed economy, a balance between a system with privately owned means of production and a public one. One thing that seperates her from her fellow friend Gorbachev is that she wants to liberalize the unions so that they could sufficiently co-exist with the industrialists.
