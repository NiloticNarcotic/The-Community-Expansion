 VNH_the_first_council_meeting:0 "The First Council Meeting"
 VNH_the_first_council_meeting_desc:0 "The warlords of Voronezh do not lust for money and power, but desire to protect freedom and opportunity for their people.  To that end, we have opened the first meeting of the Voronezh State Council, mending the divide between the former collaborators and the partisans who have returned to resist the Nazi scum.  Just as our city built the Rodina's first fleet almost 3 centuries ago, we shall build a New Russia from the ashes of our former overlords."

 VNH_a_government_for_stability:0 "A Government For Stability"
 VNH_a_government_for_stability_desc:0 "Our government isn't perfect, far from it in fact.  Until elections can be held, the council will always suffer from inefficiency without a dominant party, and corruption, as always, remains a serious issue.  Despite this, we have managed to provide our citizens a refuge from anarchy, instability, and famine, an achievement not many of our rivals can claim.  Now we can look to the future unbridled by starvation, banditry, or unrest."
 
 VNH_bulganins_ideas:0 "Bulganin's Ideas"
 VNH_bulganins_ideas_desc:0 "Bulganin is a former marshall of the Great Patriotic War and seeks to defend Voronezh from German Tyranny, Thank heavens he's on our side!"

 VNH_savvinas_altruism:0 "Savvina's Altruism"
 VNH_savvinas_altruism_desc:0 "Iya Savvina is an altruistic woman who wants to benefit the people and sideline the oligarch likes of Lukin. She proposes the liberalisation of trade unions and prioritise them over the industrialists. In these dire times, these ideas are going to damage our war effort which can cost our existence. We can however, try and tie the working closer to the state, or should we rather sideline that in favor of the industrialists like Lukin?"

 VNH_putins_demands:0 "Putins demands"
 VNH_putins_demands_desc:0 "Putin, the almightly oligarch has come to Gorbachev. He demands more tax cuts in exchange for better industry output. More of his demands also come from Lukin, who is completely on board with these ideas despite their differences."

 VNH_refuse_to_bend_to_bulganin:0 "Refuse to bend to Bulganin"
 VNH_refuse_to_bend_to_bulganin_desc:0 "Bulganins proposition has been declined by Gorbachev and his administration."

 VNH_a_need_for_strength:0 "A Need for Strength"
 VNH_a_need_for_strength_desc:0 "After the fall of Reichkommissariat Moscowien, Voronezh breaked free from German autonomy. However, Voronezh needs strength and decisiveness to face the upcoming unification wars of the Moskowien region with its neighbors, or else the young republic will perish before it had even taken it's first steps. We need to build up a powerful industry, a strong army and political stability. President Gorbachev will lead us with his young and decisive mind from this broken down region all the way to Petersburg!"
 
 VNH_focus_on_light_industry:0 "Focus on the light industry"

 VNH_a_new_training_programme:0 "A new training programme"
 VNH_a_new_training_programme_desc:0 "Recent inspections of our soldiers leave much to be desired.  Our men have the will to fight, but lack the skills or discipline to pose a threat to our enemies. A meeting has been convened by the Stavka to debate the implementation of a new training program, and so far they seem split between two camps.  One proposal says that we do not have the means to fight an open war, and should therefore train our troops for partisan warfare, focusing on winning through superior logistics and hit-and-run tactics to drain our enemies by attrition. The other faction proposes that we make up for our lack of numbers by providing our soldiers the very best equipment and enforcing strict discipline to create a small, but deadly army."

 VNH_turn_to_lukin:0 "Turn to Lukins Ideas instead"
 VNH_turn_to_lukin_desc:0 "Savvinas idealism isn't fit for the time we are in currently. Lukin has some good ideas to improve the industrial output from what we heard."

 VNH_token_promises:0 "Token Promises"
 VNH_token_promises_desc:0 "Officially, the government of Voronezh is a representative democracy. The Council of Voronezh is to be chosen by the Russian people, for the Russian people, and the right to stand in elections, speak freely, or form political parties is the right of every Russian adult.  This can't be further from the truth. Our government is controlled by oligarchs and their corporate lackeys, corruption is widespread, and the promised upcoming election seem anything but free or fair. Will anyone stand up to them?"

 VNH_eradicate_this_nonsense:0 "Eradicate this Nonsense"
 VNH_eradicate_this_nonsense_desc:0 "With Lukin expanding his industries, its no doubt that workers will try to unionize and tear down our progress. We must ban the formation of any unions before they have been created."

 VNH_but_not_too_much:0 "But Not Too Much"
 VNH_but_not_too_much_desc:0 "We have promised our people freedom, but freedom can be a dangerous thing. Above all, Voronezh needs prosperity, it needs stability, and it needs order. We have already established perfectly good political parties for the people to debate on, and the Council is finally up and running as it should. We can't let a few bad actors throw a wrench into a perfectly good status quo. Not now, not ever."
 
 VNH_revitalise_the_south_eastern_railway:0 "Revitalise the South Eastern Railway"
 VNH_revitalise_the_south_eastern_railway_desc:0 "Our campaign of guerilla warfare against the Nazi settlers and the dreaded SS cannot survive without proper logistics. We should begin work on rebuilding the South Eastern Railway immediately to ensure our boys will never lack for bullets or reinforcements. Our military shall certainly benefit from this in war, but best of all, proper railways will ensure our economy soars in the coming peace."

 VNH_compensate_the_oligarchs:0 "Compensate the oligarchs"

 VNH_stimulate_the_economy_desc:0 "A man does not live on bread alone, but he still needs bread to live.

 VNH_the_people_content:0 "The People Content"
 VNH_the_people_content_desc:0 "The situation in Voronezh is far from perfect. Political freedoms are few and far between and many are afraid to speak openly about the problems they face in fear of being labeled a communist or fascist. The economy is still in complete disarray; the poor flood the streets, thousands of rural farmers now living in slums and forced to become wage laborers. However, despite the many glaring issues the young nation still faces, there may be a ray of hope yet. With new elections on the horizon, Voronezh is on the path to becoming a shining beacon of Democracy. Government subsidies have jump-started a stagnant industry and have set the Republic on the path to becoming an industrial powerhouse. While the present may still be bleak, the future flickers with promise."









 VNH_The_Reformer:0 "The reformer"
 VNH_The_Reformer_desc:0 "Gorbachev, the former leader of the Ostvolk Council, a figurehead that liberal and conservative democracy sympathisers alike rally under. In the wake of Moskowien's collapse, he has been elected as the leader of the state of Voronezh. While a president with executive powers, he is not the only one who run Voronezh. The industrialists likes of Lukin and Putin are almost in complete control of the industry, and the army is headed by Bulganin. If he wants to survive, he will need to find a middle ground with these groups, or else face dire consequences."

 VNH_The_Artisan:0 "The artisan"
 VNH_The_Artisan_desc:0 "Ivya Savvina, a close friend of Gorbachev, an actress turned politician in the middle of the collapse. She wants a state with a mixed economy, a balance between a system with privately owned means of production and a public one. One thing that seperates her from her fellow friend Gorbachev is that she wants to liberalize the unions so that they could sufficiently co-exist with the industrialists. If anything happens to comrade Gorbachev, she is always ready to guide democracy forward the way she sees it."


 VNH_The_Oligarch:0 "The oligarch"
 VNH_The_Oligarch_desc:0 "Putin, the robber baron, whatever you call him. Putin controlls most of the industries and makes sure that Gorbachev's administration panders to him. Only Bulganin keeps him at bay from completely dominating the government."

 VNH_The_Factory_Owners:0 "The Liberals" 
 VNH_The_Factory_Owners_desc:0 "Besides Putin there are more oligarchs that keep Gorbachev hostage. Lukin's group of oligarchs split from Putin, believing that he would hinder their agenda. That said, Lukin's party want the industry to be completely decentralized, no taxes and let the monopolies expand without any interference of the government."










 VNH_council_reconvenes:0 "The council reconvenese"
