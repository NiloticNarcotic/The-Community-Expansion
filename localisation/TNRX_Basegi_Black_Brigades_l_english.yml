 ###Leader Desc###
 POLITICS_VASILY_MORDAKOV_DESC:0 "The history of Vasily Mordakov changes with every person one may ask. Some say he was orphaned during the war and lived among rats, learning to steal and thrift from them, others say he was raised in a commune of thieves and was their prodigy child. Whatever the story may be, it will undoubtedly try to explain the man's supernatural charisma and guile. Mordakov knew hardship nearly his entire life, and had to survive completely on his own.\nDaily, he would face death from hunger, cold or knife. He knew from the very early days that this world does not belong to those who do not deserve it, so when he grew up and saw with his own eyes, the measly people whom managed to live good lives protected by the confines of comfortable office jobs and communal housing. None would even last a week in the environment he grew up in.\nMordakov found work with the Pokrovsk Thieves-in-Law, a criminal organization, where he grew in rank so fast that it put fear in the upper echelons of the mafia. So it came to be, that at every opportunity, the young prodigy would be stifled. Missed details here, sloppy work there.\nIt became clear to him at one point that he is not wanted, but is badly needed in the organization.\nThe Black Brigades were like a godsend for the man. He quickly moved to greener pastures by joining up with them, proving himself to the leadership faster than in the mafia. There, he did not slow down in his pursuit of power and purpose. He built a sizable clique of those in the Brigades who strived to be more than bandits, a mere nuisance for the Germans."

 BBB_the_black_brigades:0 "The Black Brigades"
 BBB_the_black_brigades_desc:0 "In our accursed days in the Ural League, the men of the Brigades had learned the truth - truth which cost us our once comrades within the Ural League and their hospitality.\nThis world does not belong to the weak. Humanity has seemingly ignored this law since the formation of the modern state and it has shown time and time again to be a mistake for each civilization, no matter how great had fallen to the stronger.\nPhrygia, Rome, Byzantium, Britain. Even Germany is now tearing itself at the seams, reaping the weakness that they sown through their 'National Socialism'.\n\nThe league itself has grown crooked as of late, feasting on the spoils while raiding the Volga Region, but our new headsman, Vasily Mordakov has taken a much different approach. The time of our bandit days are over. This it our opportunity to teach the people of Moskowien the inevitable measures we have to take to stop the stagnation of the human race."
 
 BBB_learn_by_experience:0 "Learn by Experience"
 BBB_learn_by_experience_desc:0 "The overstreched administration of the Reichskommisariat never had a chance to stop or even hinder our activities in the Volga region. The Brigades have been living off of raiding the surrounding region for a good five years and therefore we have accustomed ourselves to the terrain, landmarks and intricacies that our enemies are unlikely to know about, even going as far to have several caches of ammunition and provisions scattered around the area.\n\nThe war against the Wolgastaat, however, is different to our usual raids. They manage a much smaller region and know the area a lot better than the oafs of Moskowien. They also have the motivation to protect their little statelet too. This doesn't mean we cannot use our advantages against them. The war in the plains will go on, and let the Germans know that we know every mound they hide behind, every turn and ambush point will become ineffective against us."
 
 BBB_twist_the_knife:0 "Twist the Knife"
 BBB_twist_the_knife_desc:0 "The momentum we have gained on our conquest against the Wolgastaat should not be thrown to waste. The more battles we fight, the more we learn of their strategies; their numbers and forces. Our greatest advantage against our enemies in this war is the skill of our troops and the knowledge of the environment in which we fight in.\nWe have to secure our victory by striking while the iron of war is hot, with no remorse and extreme prejudice.\n\nNothing is to be left to chance and no safety measures are to be taken. If we are to stay true to the principles of the Brigades, we cannot allow for cowards and the inadequate to even take a glimpse at the society which we are building.\nHitting the enemy's morale is going to be the top priority in every battle, and all underhanded tactics shall be encouraged to ensure this."
 
 BBB_salt_the_wound:0 "Salt the Wound"
 BBB_salt_the_wound_desc:0 "To add more fuel to the already blazing war machine that we have developed in this struggle of dominance over the Volga, we still must reinforce the tactics of brutality that have served us so well and allowed for the survival of the Brigades and their ideals.\n\nReinforce the idea that this conflict is more than a power struggle, because it is. The victory of the Brigades philosophy lies entirely upon the shoulders of our victory over Wolgastaat. Take no prisoners, hesitate at no shot, completely obliterate the concept of a non-combatant because there is no such thing. Even if the Brigades lose this, the hardships that the Germans of the Volga will have to face may perhaps teach them a lesson about who the future belongs to and our fight may have not been in vain."
 
 BBB_take_whats_ours:0 "Take What's Ours..."
 BBB_take_whats_ours_desc:0 "No matter how skilled and trained, soldiers cannot win a war when all they have in hand are sticks and stones, and that is what some of our equipment may as well be.\nEven though the raids during our time as the Bandits of the Volga have brought us a fair amount of wealth and a stock of old weapons and ammo, their reliability and lifespan leaves much to be desired. They are simply not in a good shape.\nOne of the ways which can counteract deficits and replace the faulty equipment will be by introducing a finders-keepers policy after a battle is won so that our men can take all that they want from the dead Germans. It will not only help us keep up with the enemies in terms of weaponry but it will also put our men deeper into the minset of the Brigades. Their only right to belongings is their ability to defend them."
 
 BBB_all_is_ours:0 "...ALL is ours"
 BBB_all_is_ours_desc:0 "It is not just the enemy soldiers which have things we need in our fight. The towns and villages dotting the Volga region are rife with anything from medical supplies, cars, trucks, fuel, even rifles and ammunition. All useful in the hands of men who deserve it more and can actually put it to good use. Anything 'found' in and outside of the battlefields can be taken with no repercussions from our officers. It will also teach the denizens of the former Reichskommisariat that their possessions are no longer safe, and they will slowly learn to protect themselves and their property tooth and nail. To some like the Americans or the Germans it is a 'drastic' war measure, but to us it is nothing more than the new, everyday reality of life. Everyone will soon adapt to this way of life and it shall only make us stronger."

 BBB_recruits_in_pokrovsk_desc:0 "Pokrovsk - formerly Kosackenstadt or Engels, depending on what scum you ask, was the latest in our conquest. For a city in an area of Moskowien generally considered pretty Germanized, the Russian population held on quite tightly. No doubt it was partly due to the powerful mafia that developed under Bukharin's corrupt administration. The reason for Pokrovsk's ethnic make-up does not matter, as either way many see the Brigades as liberators from their German Oppressors. Whether we like it or not, fighting-age men are flocking to our forces seeking to drive the knife southwards to Paulusburg - and we would be foolish to stifle their enthusiasm. While many; most, are not exactly Black Brigades material, they could definitely be put into external branches under local authority. At the very least they can serve as cannon fodder. And the survivors can be looked at afterwards."
 
 BBB_teach_them_to_survive:0 "Teach Them to Survive"
 BBB_teach_them_to_survive_desc:0 "While the Russian Thieves-in-Law and the Black Brigades are indeed separate entities, we have thoroughly cooperated in the past, present and surely will continue to do so in the future. Our headsman Vasily Mordakov himself found his way into the brigades through the mafia. He still has many connections and knows many people who could bring in support for our fight against the Wolgastaat. In particular, there are many people in Pokrovsk and Yershov who are both willing to join the Black Brigades and capable to live up to its standards.\n\nFor now, however, we should be careful in accepting many new members. Even if every single one of the recruits fits the standard for the Brigades, we cannot risk angering the mafia by putting so many people under our protection. At least so long as the mob remains the threatening force that it is."

We are not petty ideologues with fancy books and leaflets. We are men of action and action is what we will use to show the people of our domain what we want to see. Raids will not just be encouraged within the Brigades; they will be mandatory after every town 'liberated'. This is not for loot and plunder, of course - if that was what we were after we would have stuck to being the formidable force in the Volga steppes. The pain we put the people through is not for loot, but for humanity."

From a roaming bandit clique terrorizing villages like a meager fox, to standing at the feet of the Wolgabund with the bodies of a hundred bureaucratic rats, whom preferred to hide behind pens and paper than proving their strength head on, laying on the steps and staining the stones red. As our forces took the towns and villages, a whisper could be heard. One that gave a name to not us, but what we were doing - 'Black Terror'.\n\nYes. We will show those who were shielded by the cradle of a weak society what the world really is, and it is Terror."

If this idea vanishes, so too will our brigades vanish. The best way to ensure the idea’s survival in this world is with the school systems. Our students shall learn the principles and details of natural selection, of survival of the fittest, of eugenics, and of course, of evolution. In a matter of years our children shall ascend from scientific ignorance to the salvation of Darwinism. They must also learn fear.

The streetsare devoid of pedestrians and commerce, fearing that they will be kidnapped and pressed as cannon fodder or trafficked by the Mafia.  Being a criminal has become a badge of honor, as the Mafia choke out any and all competition -- and manage all aspects of the economy,both of basic goods, and more...illicit trades.

 ### Post-Unification Radicals ###
 BBB_Black_Brigades_Eternal:0 "Black Brigades Eternal!"
 BBB_Black_Brigades_Eternal_desc:0 "The calls of the insidious reformsists have finally been overturned. Their pathetic attempts at subverting our goals to satisfy their egos lie scattered; torn to shreds by the will and inevitability of human nature. Our Social Darwinism shall not be constrained by the pettiness of the state nor hampered by the modernistic false consciousness of morality.  Together, we the Black Brigades bring a new age of struggle. We will accept nothing but the strongest, fastest, smartest and most cunning and the only judge will be mother nature herself. For there is no bloodier battleground; no harsher punisher than life itself. \n\nThe memory of our origins, and the glorious legacy of the Basegi Black Brigades shall live on through what made it so strong to begin with - adherence to the Law of Nature and the understanding of the only force that makes history - strength."
 
 BBB_Cut_Off_The_Reformers:0 "Cut off the Reformers"
 BBB_Cut_Off_The_Reformers_desc:0 "The losers of this game will not go down easily.\n Ankudinov and his band of modernists still surely scheme in their high castle, trying to bastardize our new society into exactly that which we are trying to prevent.\n They may see it in another way but naivety clouds their vision, making them unable to draw their plans to their inevitable conclusion of bringing us back to the era of human stagnation that we have found ourselves in since the rennaisance.\n Our leader may have made it clear in the 'Kremlin Declaration', as it has come to be known, that the reformists' days are numbered but nevertheless, their ideology remains. There are those in the Brigades that have, or are suspected of having, reformist sympathies.\n Make sure they never see the inner circle again."
 
 BBB_Wrangle_The_Generals:0 "Wrangle the Generals"
 BBB_Wrangle_The_Generals_desc:0 "There are still some neanderthals high up within our ranks that are more loyal to the Black Brigades than to what they represent.\n They, like the reformists, pose a threat to the natural order that we have reestablished and therefore, must be taken down before they destroy all that we have fought for now that we are so close.\n Some of these men have served the Brigades dutifully ever since our beginnings in the Urals, however they have let their own fear of inadequacy and modernist delusions of shared history cloud their allegience.\n There will certainly be more fresh and new candidates that will rise to prominence within our organization, and the ones that remain after our little purge shall undoubtedly work even harder."
 
 BBB_Purge_The_Sycophants:0 "Purge the Sycophants"
 BBB_Purge_The_Sycophants_desc:0 "Some men are weak. That is not for debate.\n That does not necessarily mean that they are always useless. When the Black Brigades were first exiled from the Ural League, there was not that many of us, a couple thousand at most.\n This meant that we could not have always seeked for the strongest when looking for people to head our cause but those that happened to be appropriate for the job.\n The administrative body became a ground for those that were too afraid of challenge seeking immunity because they knew that if they were just as vulnerable as the rest, we would not be able to manage the Brigades.\n Our circumstance allowed for that to happen but with all of Moscow under our thumb we can finally live up to our principles fully.\n It is time to throw the bloated administration to the wolves and see who is actually worthy to lead the struggle for the advancement of humankind."
 
 BBB_Abolish_Germanism:0 "Abolish Germanism"
 BBB_Abolish_Germanism_desc:0 "There exists only two kinds of men in the world - the strong and the weak.\nTo us, Nationality is nothing but yet another symptom of modernism. A false consciousness to make people seek companionship among those of the same blood, not those of same might. It only serves to protect those who otherwise would not be able to protect themselves.\n Like a limping wolf which is left to die by others of its kind, so shall we abandon this notion that weakness should be tolerated, just because it it draped in the tricolour of Russia.\n There shall no longer be 'Russian' and 'German', and any sympathies to such an identity shall be erased when the strong, regardless of Nationality, dominate the weak."
 
 BBB_Good_Is_No_Longer_Enough:0 "'Good' is no longer enough"
 BBB_Good_Is_No_Longer_Enough_desc:0 "For the past decades, we have often had to make do with what and who we had. Some people we worked with, even members of the Black Brigades themselves, were sometimes inadequate with no one to take their place.\n Our situation now is different and with the vast lands of Muscovy in our hands, we also have access to the people that inhabit it. Decades of German and Soviet adminstration have undoubtedly let the unworthy masses fester and rot underneath its skin, but as nature always intends, some excel that. The Brigades have been a formidable force in Western Russia for a long time, better than most of their kind and now they are about to reach the next stage of their evolution.\n And all of Muscovy will experience that change too - toil and sweat will be the grease that turns the machine of humanity evermore."
 
 BBB_Will_To_Power:0 "Will to Power"
 BBB_Will_To_Power_desc:0 "Every man and woman is ultimately driven by one goal - to live. Coat it in as much needless luxuries as one wants, that will always be the ultimate reality when all else it taken away.\n It is through this desire that our species has come to dominate all corners of the wide world. Not because we were graced with some sort of magical power, but because our ancestors proved to all else that they were the superior breed.\n Nature punished the Neanderthals and the Erectus just as nature will punish the modernists rotting in their homes surrounded by trinkets. Our new society is built upon the will for man to gain power and to gain the upper hand in the face of those that want nothing less but the same for them."
 
 BBB_Close_The_Congress:0 "Close the Congress"
 BBB_Close_The_Congress_desc:0 "With our victory, the modernists are atomized. Many have renounced their loyalty to the reformist cause and others... well, they've been found with two bullet holes in the backs of their head.\n The opportunity for their resurgence is dwindling by the day and now we shall finally put the nail into their coffin.\n It is time to pay an unnanouced visit to their little congress and flush the rats out. Arrest or kill anyone found inside, and declare bounties on the heads of the rest. If all goes well, this will be the last time we will have to worry about dissidents.\n Find them in the shadows, scheming in Moscow alleyways and in the hills of Voronezh and put them to the wolves.\n\n Let us see how much their idealistic thought and 'realism' helps them when faced with real struggle."
 
 BBB_Directed_Anarchy:0 "Directed Anarchy"
 BBB_Directed_Anarchy_desc:0 "The feeble-minded modernists cry at the Black Brigades' hold over Muscovy, slandering it as an 'anarchist state'. It is them, with their need for endless laws and regulations made to protect those that do not even deserve to breathe the same air as the ones who built the land on which they live, that point to us as an abomination.\nNo. We do not restrict ourselves and our\npeople from using all that they have been given to prove their mettle and demonstrate their superiority.\nHaving as little laws means less barriers to natural selection, and it works far better than anything that modernism has given us. It is not liberty which we gain from this 'anarchy', quite the contrary - it is to separate the weak from the strong so that only those who truly deserve a future manage to obtain one."
 
 BBB_Terror_Groups:0 "Terror Groups"
 BBB_Terror_Groups_desc:0 "The biggest enemy to our cause is and always will be communities. Communities are built by people who cannot survive in nature and thus, have to seek protection from others to be able to spread their inferior genes. It would be difficult to do anything about that fact, if it were not for mother nature herself providing the solution for us.\n\n The effects of the Black Brigades' dawn are increasingly more visible every day. The weak are tormented by the strong who roam the streets and countryside. The revitalization of the predator is our duty, and it would seem that we are more successful with each body lying limp on the streets. A body of one who was not able to outrun his own weakness, and thus was taken down by the strong. But as is always with death - with the fall of one, another thrives on their spoils, and only those that are worthy inherit the world."
 
 BBB_Brotherhood_In_Strength:0 "Brotherhood in Strength"
 BBB_Brotherhood_In_Strength_desc:0 "Cameraderie is made through commonality.\nAs much as this is expolited by the weak to hide from the struggle of survival, it can also be a beacon of opportunity for the strong too.\nRather than shielding the weak, these gangs, mafias and syndicates, that have began to shape day to day life in Muscovy, demand strength and courage from our citizens. Their brutal nature serves to greatly favour our cause by regularly terrorizing the weak and forcing people to either become stronger or live in shame and fear.\nSome, through exceptional prestige, even provide good recruits for the Black Brigades themselves.\n\nThis seems to be the new norm for people in Muscovy, and it will only get better from here, as these gangs attract more and more strong men seeking brotherhood and companionship. For those that deserve it should only be among the strongest."
 
 BBB_Enforced_No_Longer:0 "Enforced no Longer"
 BBB_Enforced_No_Longer_desc:"For the longest time, the brigades often times have had to step in personally to select the weak and the strong from the masses.\nIt was in a time where the understanding of our cause was so close, yet so far to many people. Some would prove to be the correct decision, serving the Brigades diligently and with no mercy.\nOthers, not so much. The reformists, though gone, served to show that man's instinct in choosing the strong is heavily flawed.\nThey were sheep in wolves' clothing and only used this flawed instinct to burrow themselves into our ranks and rot them from within. The utopia we are creating here has no such issue. There is no more need for us to step in and intervene where nature can take its toll in its own way. Man will either find a way or die knowing they were never meant for great things."

 BBB_Wolves_Among_Sheep:0 "Wolves among Sheep"
 BBB_Wolves_Among_Sheep_desc:"We the Black Brigades exemplify the pinnacle of the will to one's power.\nOur history is one of the most fearsome bandit brigades in history; trained in the harshest environments and enduring the darkest of days.\nBut there are many like us in that regard; The Black League, The Schutzstaffe, the SAS. We have something that makes us superior to all of them and that is knowledge and acknowledgement of the reality of human nature.\nAt the end of the day, after all the training and fighting is done, these 'elite forces' will go back to their families, to their political parties and to their possessions. They let weaker men rule over them because that is what they are told to believe, when they could easily overpower them and put themselves above. And it seems that for the forseeable future, that is how it will remain.\n\nThe Basegi Black Brigades - Wolves among flocks and flocks of sheep."
 
 BBB_The_Only_Law:0 "The Only Law"
 BBB_The_Only_Law_desc:"Man has one purpose. To survive. All else is luxury.\nOne may bite, kick, claw their way to the top and that is all that will ever matter, for a dead man cannot cry that their killer was unfair.\nThis is the world now and forever, and our purpose is to teach people of this reality. It will hurt at first, but slowly over the years, with weaklings dead and the strong thriving only for the bar of who is weak and who is strong to raise forever until what the strong man is in Germany, America and Japan is nothing but a neanderthal; a backwards creature to the men of Muscovy.\n\nThese are not calculations of some wanna-be philosopher or phony scientist sitting on their piles of functionless books. This is reality, and how man has advanced to the stage he finds himself in today, and we will make sure that this law is made clear to everyone forever."

 blackbrigades.1.desc:0 "Since the dawn of man it has always been blatantly obvious that the strong dominate the weak. Never has this not been true until recent times, where there is a strange notion among people that might does not make right, that we ought to give special care for those below us in capability. Vasily Mordakov scoffs at such a ludicrous notion. “Who is man, to try and look past the natural evolutionary ordering of things? Nature is our creator, and by her laws of natural selection and survival of the fittest we must live” he thinks. Thankfully, Mordakov now leads the Basegi Black Brigades, filled with like-minded individuals, ready to reestablish a truly natural law over the land, using the measures that it permits in order to do so."

 blackbrigades.6.desc:0 "Vasily Mordakov sat as his desk, "admiring" the pile of reports and paperwork left for him by the secretary.  "Jesus Christ," he thought to himself.  His whole life, he had been a fighter, and now he was at a desk?  No matter then.  Mordakov shooed thesecretary after "admiring" her for a second, and then got to work.  Paper after paper told reports of victories, of loot, of... \n\nseized shops?  A butcher's shop?  A bakery?  A shoe store?  What the fuck are these going to do for the Brigade?  No, it was time for the Black Brigades to test their mettle.  There were much bigger fish to fry.  \n\n"This factory is now under the management of the Basegi Black Brigades!" yelled the Sergeant.  "You can't do this!  You wouldn't believe the work I had to do to even get the Germans to let me run this arms factory!"  "The Germans?"  A shot rang out, then another.  "Any other German-collaborating scum that resists will meet the same fate!" the voicerang out.  Row after row of soldiers swarmed onto the factory floor, taking any armaments they found and quickly establishing a perimeter around the building.  \n\n"From now on, you shall work for the Black Brigades!  Your products belong to us!  You shall sell them at a rate we see fit!  You will meet your quotas, and you will sell to whoever we ask you to sell!  Any strikes, any attempts at sabotage, and any missedquotas will be punished severely!  Glory to the Black Brigades!"  The workers cringed from the rattle of the megaphone, but it musthave been better than the fate their old boss had received.  None ever dared to challenge their new masters.  Life had to go on, and at the end of the day, who cared what warlord they were making bullets and shells for?  They would always be slaves to someone, even if these masters generously paid them barely enough to live.  For the Black Brigades, however, this was a triumph.  No longer would the Brigades experience weakness.  No longer would their banditry be limited to isolated outposts and small shops.  Factories, farms, airfields, bases, cities!  Nothing was not up for the taking.  Soon all of Muscovy would fear their might. \n\nOpportunity comes to those who seize it."

Show me what you can do with them" \n\n-"Sure thing"- he said \n\nAnd the brawl went as he planned."

The current brawls and fights going on in the city made the pre-collapse era look alright. With the situation completely deteriorated and the settlers being violently persecuted, Elisabeth has no choice but to make her way back home, which is currently in a full blown internal conflict. She quickly began moving westwards of the city, doing her best at avoiding the militia in the streets. She met up with other German settlers that were attempting to flee, some of them even carrying worn Kar98k rifles. \n\nAs Elisabeth and other refugees arrived at the end of the city, they felt relief that was immediately cut by gunfire from their backs. It were the black brigades who caught up on them and are trying to punish the teutons for their cowardness and that they had stepped on the russian land. Women and children began screaming, while the men with Kar98k's began shooting back in efforts to delay the bandits. One of the armed men shouted to the refugees; \n\n-"Raus! Tell the vaterland that we didn't die in vain!" \n\nElisabeth listened to the shout. She didn't say anything, but kept that in mind. \n\nLater that evening, Elisabeth and other surviving refugees left the city and headed to the west, where the fanatic brigades haven't arrived yet."

 blackbrigades.12.desc:0 "When one reaches the age of old mister Razumkov, they tend not to worry too much about the world around them. He is much more concerned with his health, or his children as they grow older. But most of all, Razumkov is all too endearing of his little corner shop. It was a small shop, and it was an old one too, one his grandfather started all those years ago, when things were so much simpler. From the floorboards to the windows, not an inch of rot nor a speck of dust dare threaten the pristine condition of Razumkov's shop. They know better by now, of course. Razumkov was an old man. He had seen much in all his years, even in his fervent youth, the wave of revolution swept him into the workers and peasants red army. Yes, he really had seen it all, more than others could say atleast. But those days were long behind him, distant memories, faded to time. In his age, when the Reich plowed across the east like a train with broken brakes, Razumkov had grown apathetic to who lorded over him. A boss was a boss, whether or not they spoke Russian or German was of no concern to him. As long as he could see his boy grow up, old man Razumkov was the happiest man alive.\n\nIt was a hazy evening, this years Rasputitsa had finally regressed, and the flow of wanderers and workers slowly began to trickle into the village once more. Though, recently in the past few weeks, it was oddly quiet. Not even his son would return from work like he always did from the village further north. Infact, he hasn't heard from that village for a week or so. But Razumkov was too old to worry, he could only assume that there was simple delays. Nowadays it's likely the worst, whatever that could possibly be, has happened. Most have just come to accept that now, most just do what they can to survive alone. It was saturday, he usually swept today. It was a part of his routine to do so, any semblance of pattern in order to keep him going. The rigid tissles of the old, rugged broom glazed delicately along the stainless wooden floor, a steel pan to swipe the dust into so he could dispose of it outside. His back ached as he lurched down to grab the dustpan, reminding Razumkov of his age. As he stood up, he looked down into the dustpan. The delicate bits and pieces of scrap and dust inanimately awaited to be discarded, and old man Razumkov shuffled to his shops front door. Outside, suppressed mumbling didn't manage to evade his aged but attentive ears. Curious, he placed his ear against the wooden door, but disappointed yet further intrigued to realise that even then, it was still too muffled.\n\nHe closed his eyes for but a moment, and reached for the door handle, as the door squeaked in it's similar aging condition, Razumkov came eye to eye with two young men, with tri-colour patches on their shoulders. Their clothing was rugged, with it looking vaguely like fatigues and a steel helmet covering both of their heads. They seemed startled, and the old man was just as confused. He parted his lips to speak, barely uttering a gasp as one suddenly reaching to his side. An old dog still remembers his old tricks, and despite his shaky hand and bad grip, the old man flicked out an old revolver. A hurried gasp escaped the other mens lips as they reached for their own firearms tucked away, but the old man was quicker. A sharp crack filled the morning silence. A cry, a shout, and the slam of a door ensued. Razumkovs heart pounded in his chest, eyes wide with fear.\n\n"You bastard! You old bastard! I'll gut you, I'll gut you like the weak old shit you are!"\n\nRazumkov rubbed his forehead as he leaned up against his shoot door, the faint gags of a dying man from outside swelled his conscious. Remorse and fear pulsed through his veins, but the sudden shattering of his shops window brought him back to his senses. But alas, not fast enough. The brigadier had already drawn his chopped down mosin-nagant, a remnant of the past. Razumkov never expected to see an obrez, something so iconic with the revolution be pointed at him. But regardless, a bullet ripped, and leather tore. The old man gasped sharply, as a searing pain pulsed through his arm, his revolver firing off as it fell from his grip. A similar, youthful cry of pain echoed his own, and Razumkov found the intruder writhing in pain against the wall, gripping his hand with a gaping hole. Razumkov was old, unable to push past his pain as he gripped his bicep, huffing and groaning weakly in pain against the wall. But an enraged, shrill cry of pain induced rage escaped the intruders lips, and charged Razumkov headfirst. His old eyes closed, merely flinching in instinct as he was thrown and pinned to the ground. A mere gasp left him, before one shot to his heart ended it all. His deep crimson blood seeped from him, dripping down and out the doorframe, finding itself spilling down the same old drain as the young mans, and an array of glass shards dyed red, with no old man to clean them."

 blackbrigades.14.t:0 "Mercy is for the weak"
 blackbrigades.14.desc:0 "Ivan Shetsov had worked in the Volgograd Arms Factory for forty-six years.  When he had started at the age of 18, he made his Mosin-Nagant 1891 rifles in Tsaritsyn, and his bullets were shot at the enemies of the Tsar.  At 41, he made PPSh submachine guns in Voroshilovgrad, for the defense of Lenin and Bukharin's Worker's Revolution against the enemies of the Soviet Union.  At 45, hewas the factory floor leader, but now he had a German looking over him, presumably as "guidance" from his generous "liberators fromJudeo-Bolshevism," whatever the hell that meant, but the Walther in his pocket, one of the guns his floor was now making, told a different story.  And when he was 63 years old, the Germans fled his factory, and he could only wonder why they would leave so many new LAG G1 rifles to waste.  The next day, he found out why.The soldiers, clad in dark grey and black, seemed at first glance to be SS men.  How surprised Ivan was when he heard them yelling in Russian!  At last, the city of "Paulusburg" -- a horrific bastardization, would return to the rule of Great Russians.  His dreams werequickly dashed by the sound of a megaphone up to his ear; "This factory is now under the management of the Basegi Black Brigades!  Youwill make weapons for us!  You will work fast and you will work hard for us!  Laziness will cost you your job!  Sabotage will cost you your life!  For the strong, there will be liberation, and the weak, you shall perish!  Long live the Black Brigades!"Ivan rushed to find the commander of these strange bandits, before being smacked with the butt of a rifle.  Now dazed on the floor, theostensible commander of the group offered him his hand, lifted him up, and then smacked him again.  What a way to treat an old man!  Within minutes, he was thrown back onto the factory floor, not as a manager, but as merely another worker.  Surprisingly, his formersubordinates treated him with all the solidarity that one should expect from their fellow countrymen, in a time when Ivan doubtedwhether his country might ever be whole again.  No matter then, he had been making rifles longer than most of these boys had been alive.  A few days later, a soldier came up behind him while he was working, grabbed him by the back of his collar, and dragged him out of thefactory floor.  In outrage, Ivan tried to resist, but he was too old to offer any pain to the bandit who had taken him.  After beingmanhandled out of the factory entirely, an officer coldly informed him that he worked too slowly to meet the needs of the growingBlack Brigades.  A younger man had already took his place, and was meeting 121% of the daily quotas.  Ivan Shetsov, a man who hadworked in this factory for forty-six years, earned starving to death as his pension."

 blackbrigades.15.t:0 "German war machine"
 blackbrigades.15.desc:0 "The recent history of the Germans in Russia has not exactly led to most Russians liking the German people.  In 1941, the German Horde smashed through Bukharin's unprepared Red Army, weakened by political purges and incompetent officers, and woefully incapable of matching the German "Blitzkrieg" -- columns of Panzers smashed through Soviet lines like butter, their bombers pounded our cities into dust, and their SS bands slaughtered our people and herded them into slavery.  There is not a single soul among us that couldpossibly have any love for the Germans.  They are murderous scum who raped and tortured our beautiful Motherland, who made her bleed ashes. \n\nDespite this, we cannot deny that the Germans had an immense war industry and a world-class army that easily bested our men in the field.  They were the strong, and like a pack of hungry wolves, ripped up the sheep that was the Red Army.  The Black Brigades have always believed in survival of the fittest, that those who are strong deserve to live, and to prey upon the weak.  Therefore, it has been decided that we should learn from those that defeated us.  \n\nFirstly, we have gotten our hands on a great deal of German made infantry weapons, artillery, and trucks.  Our soldiers should be equipped with and trained in the use of these high quality arms, as they are far superior than anything else being used in what was once the Reichskommissariat.  Secondly, we should begin to train armored troops, and form tank units using captured German Panzer Xs, Leopards, and APCs.  The Germans proved to us the value of tanks, especially when supported by armored infantry in the Great Patriotic War, and the West Russian War. \n\nMost of all, however, we must learn from the Germans' brutality.  The Black Brigades are an organization that takes pride in inflicting fear upon its enemies.  The Germans are perhaps responsible for the deaths of perhaps tens of millions of Russians.  They showed no mercy in dealing with Partisans and the Red Army alike, and we should do the same. The Brigades have never been one to take prisoners.  We must take this a step further - civilians will be terrorized, and men and women alike will be put to work for us.  Those men that are worthy shall be accepted into the Brigades, whether they like it or not.  Furthermore, the Thieves in Law will be allowed to appropriate businesses as they see fit, "protect" merchants, or engage in criminal trades without interference from petty things like police and laws.  \n\nAll of Russia will know of our terror.  None may love us, but all will fear us.  That is the natural order of things. \n\nVasily Mordakov, Commander in Chief of the Basegi Black Brigades."

Children flee from me!  The Gods of Death have blessed me, I am the Dark Prince of Murder!  Satan's Legions stand at my command.  Russia is MINE!  RELEASE ME AT ONCE!"  The guard put corks in his ears before lighting his cigarette.  He did not get paid enough to for this shit.  This was a prison, not a fucking loony bin.  Apparently, this guy had been the leader ofsome bandit army called the "Bogi Smerti" - and after meeting the brigade, their name became very appropriate, with most of the army of this "Antikhrist" figure massacred by the Black Brigades' superior soldiers.  Surely, when Mordakov gave those speeches on Survival of the Fittest, he probably was hoping for stronger prey than these fanatics?After a few more hours of listening to the incessant rants of this maniac, the guard very much looked forward to the end of his shift.Apparently, this maniac's real name was Andrei Chikatilo, wanted by the Moskowische Ordnungspolizei for over 20 different murders and rapes.  "Wonderful fellow," he thought to himself.  Just as his shift was about to end, three other guards and an officer came to the cell.  "My shift isn't over for another 15 minutes sir."  "The prisoner has visitors," the officer replied in a gruff voice.  "Who?"  "Us.  Now open the gate private.  You are relieved for the day."  He did not question the order, opening the cell and handing the keysto the captain before going home to the barracks for the evening.  As he left the cell block, he heard muffled sounds of screaming and the clang of steel batons.  He chuckled to himself a little.  The Brigades were experts in spreading chaos, and yet as Chikatilowas beaten to death in his cell, he couldn't help but laugh at the irony that they were the only ones who had brought justice to his victims.  Not that he cared either way.  The Brigades paid him on time, and they paid him well.  And if a few Satan-worshipping rapistsgot killed for it, fine with him."

It must have been around ten minutes since the door last shut with an audible screech of unoiled metal. The leader, now at a podium ready to speak, cleared his throat.\n\n"My brothers, we have come very far in our mission." His voice echoed, slightly malformed due to the aged speakers, "We have not once hesitated in the face of enemies, even ones that may have seemed stronger. Yet, as nature always intends, we proved ourselves mightier and now we hold all of the former Reichskommisariat." The attendees felt slightly confused at this gathering.

They will face every day knowing that it could be their last, that others are looking to kick them out of the gene pool not because we do not care for them, but because we care for the good of our species." Ankudinov's face slowly turned grey as he began to realize what this speech was. It was a thinly-veiled assault on the clique that he had formed to build a state out of the anarchy.\n\n"Nothing and no one," Mordakov paused for a second to look around the hall into the eyes of a select few, "shall intervene in the natural state of mankind.
