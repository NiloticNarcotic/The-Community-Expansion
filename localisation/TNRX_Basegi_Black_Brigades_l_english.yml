 ###Leader Desc###
 POLITICS_VASILY_MORDAKOV_DESC:0 "The history of Vasily Mordakov changes with every person one may ask. Some say he was orphaned during the war and lived among rats, learning to steal and thrift from them, others say he was raised in a commune of thieves and was their prodigy child. Whatever the story may be, it will undoubtedly try to explain the man's supernatural charisma and guile. Mordakov knew hardship nearly his entire life, and had to survive completely on his own.\nDaily, he would face death from hunger, cold or knife. He knew from the very early days that this world does not belong to those who do not deserve it, so when he grew up and saw with his own eyes, the measly people whom managed to live good lives protected by the confines of comfortable office jobs and communal housing. None would even last a week in the environment he grew up in.\nMordakov found work with the Pokrovsk Thieves-in-Law, a criminal organization, where he grew in rank so fast that it put fear in the upper echelons of the mafia. So it came to be, that at every opportunity, the young prodigy would be stifled. Missed details here, sloppy work there.\nIt became clear to him at one point that he is not wanted, but is badly needed in the organization.\nThe Black Brigades were like a godsend for the man. He quickly moved to greener pastures by joining up with them, proving himself to the leadership faster than in the mafia. There, he did not slow down in his pursuit of power and purpose. He built a sizable clique of those in the Brigades who strived to be more than bandits, a mere nuisance for the Germans."

 BBB_the_black_brigades_desc:0 "In our accursed days in the Ural League, the men of the Brigades had learned the truth - truth which cost us our once comrades within the Ural League and their hospitality.\nThis world does not belong to the weak. Humanity has seemingly ignored this law since the formation of the modern state and it has shown time and time again to be a mistake for each civilization, no matter how great had fallen to the stronger.\nPhrygia, Rome, Byzantium, Britain. Even Germany is now tearing itself at the seams, reaping the weakness that they sown through their 'National Socialism'.\n\nThe league itself has grown crooked as of late, feasting on the spoils while raiding the Volga Region, but our new headsman, Vasily Mordakov has taken a much different approach. The time of our bandit days are over. This it our opportunity to teach the people of Moskowien the inevitable measures we have to take to stop the stagnation of the human race."
 
 BBB_learn_by_experience:0 "Learn by Experience"
 BBB_learn_by_experience_desc:0 "The overstreched administration of the Reichskommisariat never had a chance to stop or even hinder our activities in the Volga region. The Brigades have been living off of raiding the surrounding region for a good five years and therefore we have accustomed ourselves to the terrain, landmarks and intricacies that our enemies are unlikely to know about, even going as far to have several caches of ammunition and provisions scattered around the area.\n\nThe war against the Wolgastaat, however, is different to our usual raids. They manage a much smaller region and know the area a lot better than the oafs of Moskowien. They also have the motivation to protect their little statelet too. This doesn't mean we cannot use our advantages against them. The war in the plains will go on, and let the Germans know that we know every mound they hide behind, every turn and ambush point will become ineffective against us."
 
 BBB_twist_the_knife:0 "Twist the Knife"
 BBB_twist_the_knife_desc:0 "The momentum we have gained on our conquest against the Wolgastaat should not be thrown to waste. The more battles we fight, the more we learn of their strategies; their numbers and forces. Our greatest advantage against our enemies in this war is the skill of our troops and the knowledge of the environment in which we fight in.\nWe have to secure our victory by striking while the iron of war is hot, with no remorse and extreme prejudice.\n\nNothing is to be left to chance and no safety measures are to be taken. If we are to stay true to the principles of the Brigades, we cannot allow for cowards and the inadequate to even take a glimpse at the society which we are building.\nHitting the enemy's morale is going to be the top priority in every battle, and all underhanded tactics shall be encouraged to ensure this."
 
 BBB_salt_the_wound:0 "Salt the Wound"
 BBB_salt_the_wound_desc:0 "To add more fuel to the already blazing war machine that we have developed in this struggle of dominance over the Volga, we still must reinforce the tactics of brutality that have served us so well and allowed for the survival of the Brigades and their ideals.\n\nReinforce the idea that this conflict is more than a power struggle, because it is. The victory of the Brigades philosophy lies entirely upon the shoulders of our victory over Wolgastaat. Take no prisoners, hesitate at no shot, completely obliterate the concept of a non-combatant because there is no such thing. Even if the Brigades lose this, the hardships that the Germans of the Volga will have to face may perhaps teach them a lesson about who the future belongs to and our fight may have not been in vain."
 
 BBB_take_whats_ours:0 "Take What's Ours..."
 BBB_take_whats_ours_desc:0 "No matter how skilled and trained, soldiers cannot win a war when all they have in hand are sticks and stones, and that is what some of our equipment may as well be.\nEven though the raids during our time as the Bandits of the Volga have brought us a fair amount of wealth and a stock of old weapons and ammo, their reliability and lifespan leaves much to be desired. They are simply not in a good shape.\nOne of the ways which can counteract deficits and replace the faulty equipment will be by introducing a finders-keepers policy after a battle is won so that our men can take all that they want from the dead Germans. It will not only help us keep up with the enemies in terms of weaponry but it will also put our men deeper into the minset of the Brigades. Their only right to belongings is their ability to defend them."
 
 BBB_all_is_ours:0 "...ALL is ours"
 BBB_all_is_ours_desc:0 "It is not just the enemy soldiers which have things we need in our fight. The towns and villages dotting the Volga region are rife with anything from medical supplies, cars, trucks, fuel, even rifles and ammunition. All useful in the hands of men who deserve it more and can actually put it to good use. Anything 'found' in and outside of the battlefields can be taken with no repercussions from our officers. It will also teach the denizens of the former Reichskommisariat that their possessions are no longer safe, and they will slowly learn to protect themselves and their property tooth and nail. To some like the Americans or the Germans it is a 'drastic' war measure, but to us it is nothing more than the new, everyday reality of life. Everyone will soon adapt to this way of life and it shall only make us stronger."
 
 BBB_recruits_in_pokrovsk:0 "Recruits in Pokrovsk"
 BBB_recruits_in_pokrovsk_desc:0 "Pokrovsk - formerly Kosackenstadt or Engels, depending on what scum you ask, was the latest in our conquest. For a city in an area of Moskowien generally considered pretty Germanized, the Russian population held on quite tightly. No doubt it was partly due to the powerful mafia that developed under Bukharin's corrupt administration. The reason for Pokrovsk's ethnic make-up does not matter, as either way many see the Brigades as liberators from their German Oppressors. Whether we like it or not, fighting-age men are flocking to our forces seeking to drive the knife southwards to Paulusburg - and we would be foolish to stifle their enthusiasm. While many; most, are not exactly Black Brigades material, they could definitely be put into external branches under local authority. At the very least they can serve as cannon fodder. And the survivors can be looked at afterwards."

 BBB_teach_them_to_survive_desc:0 "While the Russian Thieves-in-Law and the Black Brigades are indeed separate entities, we have thoroughly cooperated in the past, present and surely will continue to do so in the future. Our headsman Vasily Mordakov himself found his way into the brigades through the mafia. He still has many connections and knows many people who could bring in support for our fight against the Wolgastaat. In particular, there are many people in Pokrovsk and Yershov who are both willing to join the Black Brigades and capable to live up to its standards.\n\nFor now, however, we should be careful in accepting many new members. Even if every single one of the recruits fits the standard for the Brigades, we cannot risk angering the mafia by putting so many people under our protection. At least so long as the mob remains the threatening force that it is."
 
 BBB_show_our_strength:0 "Show our Strength"
 BBB_show_our_strength_desc:0 "As we march southwards, we cannot forget the purpose of the entire endeavour. Too many see us as either liberators who've come to save the people from German tyranny, or as deranged Russian revanchists coming to slaughter them for the crimes that they have not even committed. We are not petty ideologues with fancy books and leaflets. We are men of action and action is what we will use to show the people of our domain what we want to see. Raids will not just be encouraged within the Brigades; they will be mandatory after every town 'liberated'. This is not for loot and plunder, of course - if that was what we were after we would have stuck to being the formidable force in the Volga steppes. The pain we put the people through is not for loot, but for humanity."

From a roaming bandit clique terrorizing villages like a meager fox, to standing at the feet of the Wolgabund with the bodies of a hundred bureaucratic rats, whom preferred to hide behind pens and paper than proving their strength head on, laying on the steps and staining the stones red. As our forces took the towns and villages, a whisper could be heard. One that gave a name to not us, but what we were doing - 'Black Terror'.\n\nYes. We will show those who were shielded by the cradle of a weak society what the world really is, and it is Terror."

Thankfully, Russia is in no shortage of brave men, strong men, men worthy to join us on our crusade as well.  It is the right of these men, the right of us, to rule.  It is the right of us to conquer, to loot, to kill.  The weak are our prey, and we will not spare a single one an end to their pathetic existence."

Our students shall learn the principles and details of natural selection, of survival of the fittest, of eugenics, and of course, of evolution. In a matter of years our children shall ascend from scientific ignorance to the salvation of Darwinism. They must also learn fear.

 BBB_Good_Is_No_Longer_Enough_desc:0 "For the past decades, we have often had to make do with what and who we had. Some people we worked with, even members of the Black Brigades themselves, were sometimes inadequate with no one to take their place.\n Our situation now is different and with the vast lands of Muscovy in our hands, we also have access to the people that inhabit it. Decades of German and Soviet adminstration have undoubtedly let the unworthy masses fester and rot underneath its skin, but as nature always intends, some excel that. The Brigades have been a formidable force in Western Russia for a long time, better than most of their kind and now they are about to reach the next stage of their evolution.\n And all of Muscovy will experience that change too - toil and sweat will be the grease that turns the machine of humanity evermore."

Coat it in as much needless luxuries as one wants, that will always be the ultimate reality when all else it taken away.\n It is through this desire that our species has come to dominate all corners of the wide world. Not because we were graced with some sort of magical power, but because our ancestors proved to all else that they were the superior breed.\n Nature punished the Neanderthals and the Erectus just as nature will punish the modernists rotting in their homes surrounded by trinkets. Our new society is built upon the will for man to gain power and to gain the upper hand in the face of those that want nothing less but the same for them."

Many have renounced their loyalty to the reformist cause and others... well, they've been found with two bullet holes in the backs of their head.\n The opportunity for their resurgence is dwindling by the day and now we shall finally put the nail into their coffin.\n It is time to pay an unnanouced visit to their little congress and flush the rats out. Arrest or kill anyone found inside, and declare bounties on the heads of the rest. If all goes well, this will be the last time we will have to worry about dissidents.\n Find them in the shadows, scheming in Moscow alleyways and in the hills of Voronezh and put them to the wolves.\n\n Let us see how much their idealistic thought and 'realism' helps them when faced with real struggle."

It is them, with their need for endless laws and regulations made to protect those that do not even deserve to breathe the same air as the ones who built the land on which they live, that point to us as an abomination.\nNo. We do not restrict ourselves and our\npeople from using all that they have been given to prove their mettle and demonstrate their superiority.\nHaving as little laws means less barriers to natural selection, and it works far better than anything that modernism has given us. It is not liberty which we gain from this 'anarchy', quite the contrary - it is to separate the weak from the strong so that only those who truly deserve a future manage to obtain one."

Communities are built by people who cannot survive in nature and thus, have to seek protection from others to be able to spread their inferior genes. It would be difficult to do anything about that fact, if it were not for mother nature herself providing the solution for us.\n\n The effects of the Black Brigades' dawn are increasingly more visible every day. The weak are tormented by the strong who roam the streets and countryside. The revitalization of the predator is our duty, and it would seem that we are more successful with each body lying limp on the streets. A body of one who was not able to outrun his own weakness, and thus was taken down by the strong. But as is always with death - with the fall of one, another thrives on their spoils, and only those that are worthy inherit the world."

Their brutal nature serves to greatly favour our cause by regularly terrorizing the weak and forcing people to either become stronger or live in shame and fear.\nSome, through exceptional prestige, even provide good recruits for the Black Brigades themselves.\n\nThis seems to be the new norm for people in Muscovy, and it will only get better from here, as these gangs attract more and more strong men seeking brotherhood and companionship.

Some would prove to be the correct decision, serving the Brigades diligently and with no mercy.\nOthers, not so much. The reformists, though gone, served to show that man's instinct in choosing the strong is heavily flawed.\nThey were sheep in wolves' clothing and only used this flawed instinct to burrow themselves into our ranks and rot them from within. The utopia we are creating here has no such issue. There is no more need for us to step in and intervene where nature can take its toll in its own way.

We have something that makes us superior to all of them and that is knowledge and acknowledgement of the reality of human nature.\nAt the end of the day, after all the training and fighting is done, these 'elite forces' will go back to their families, to their political parties and to their possessions. They let weaker men rule over them because that is what they are told to believe, when they could easily overpower them and put themselves above.

It will hurt at first, but slowly over the years, with weaklings dead and the strong thriving only for the bar of who is weak and who is strong to raise forever until what the strong man is in Germany, America and Japan is nothing but a neanderthal; a backwards creature to the men of Muscovy.\n\nThese are not calculations of some wanna-be philosopher or phony scientist sitting on their piles of functionless books.

 blackbrigades.1.desc:0 "Since the dawn of man it has always been blatantly obvious that the strong dominate the weak. Never has this not been true until recent times, where there is a strange notion among people that might does not make right, that we ought to give special care for those below us in capability. Vasily Mordakov scoffs at such a ludicrous notion. “Who is man, to try and look past the natural evolutionary ordering of things? Nature is our creator, and by her laws of natural selection and survival of the fittest we must live” he thinks. Thankfully, Mordakov now leads the Basegi Black Brigades, filled with like-minded individuals, ready to reestablish a truly natural law over the land, using the measures that it permits in order to do so."

 blackbrigades.91.desc:0 "Vasily Mordakov faced the seasoned veterans of the Black Brigade at the Kremlin. The atmosphere felt tense as members trickled in one by one, called to meet just the last day. Few spoke, and those that did were quiet in their tone like students in a class. It must have been around ten minutes since the door last shut with an audible screech of unoiled metal. The leader, now at a podium ready to speak, cleared his throat.\n\n"My brothers, we have come very far in our mission." His voice echoed, slightly malformed due to the aged speakers, "We have not once hesitated in the face of enemies, even ones that may have seemed stronger. Yet, as nature always intends, we proved ourselves mightier and now we hold all of the former Reichskommisariat." The attendees felt slightly confused at this gathering. The victory speech was done weeks ago.\n\n"Man and woman will struggle and wry to survive. They will face every day knowing that it could be their last, that others are looking to kick them out of the gene pool not because we do not care for them, but because we care for the good of our species." Ankudinov's face slowly turned grey as he began to realize what this speech was. It was a thinly-veiled assault on the clique that he had formed to build a state out of the anarchy.\n\n"Nothing and no one," Mordakov paused for a second to look around the hall into the eyes of a select few, "shall intervene in the natural state of mankind. From now on, the fate of every person in Moscow shall be decided only by one and only thing - strength..."\n\n As the speech continued, Ankudinov stood forzen in the back. Was there any way he could still save this?"

The struggle of day to day life thickens the skin, energizes the blood and strengthens the bones of men with each generation. The state of nature that had propelled humanity from swamps and caves onto every corner of the earth has been put back into motion by the Black Brigades, once a simple pest for the German settlers on the Volga, who have now become the forerunners of evolution. It is doubtless that there are stronger nations out there; Germany already increasing activity on our border, but it is men who form the backbone of any nation. At the helm of everything stands Mordakov, the sole leviathan of this society. But his role is different from others like him. His power exists so that none other may take it and twist it into mockeries of humanity, stifling evolution once more. The Black Brigades march on into the future, while the rest of humanity stagnates in a pool of their own decadence."
